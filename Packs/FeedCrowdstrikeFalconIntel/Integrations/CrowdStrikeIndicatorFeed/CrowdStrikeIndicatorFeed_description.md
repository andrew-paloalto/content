To define a CrowdStrike API client, you must be designated as Falcon Administrator role to view, create, or modify API clients or keys. Secrets are only shown when a new API Client is created or when it is reset.

1. Log in into the Falcon UI
2. Navigate to Support > API Clients and Keys
3. From there you can view existing clients, add new API clients, or view the audit log.
